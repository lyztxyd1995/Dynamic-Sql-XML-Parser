# Dynamic Sql XML Parser For Java

A light-weight, simple and fast library to generate dynamic sql query from XML based on Java. The goal of this library is 
to help Java developers easily write sql queries without painful concatenating strings of SQL. With writing sql and adding tags in XML files, all sql queries could be decoupled from the Java code and become dynamic and easily maintainable. This library only performs as a sql query generator, not an executor or ORM. Therefore, it could be easily integrated with any othe ORM frameworks, JPA (like Hibernate) and JDBC.
